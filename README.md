## What is Emerge?

EMERGE [Evidence-based Measures of Empowerment for Research on Gender Equality] is a project focused on gender equality and empowerment measures used in India and other multi-country settings to monitor and evaluate health programs and to track progress on UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5: To Achieve Gender Equality and Empower All Girls. As reported by UN Women (2018), only 2 of the 14 SDG 5 indicators have accepted methodologies for measurement and data widely available. Of the remaining 12, 9 are indicators for which data are collected and available in only a limited number of countries. This assessment suggests notable measurement gaps in the state of gender equality and empowerment worldwide. EMERGE aims to improve the science of gender equality and empowerment measurement by identifying these gaps through the compilation and psychometric evaluation of available measures and supporting scientifically rigorous measure development research in India.

This site serves as a culmination of EMERGE research efforts. Information regarding the extracted and assessed measures can be found under Measurement. All measures have been grouped along 9 core dimensions: Psychological, Social, Economic, Legal, Political, Health, Household and Intrafamilial Relations, Environment and Sustainability, and Time-Poverty.

Emerge will be introducing a new, streamlined data entry system. The new system will allow users to upload measures of their own which are then validated by a QC team at Emerge before being uploaded to the site.
